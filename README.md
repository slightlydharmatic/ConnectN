# ConnectN
ConnectN is a multiplayer game that allows interactive or non-interactive users to play connect 4 with a variable number of consecutive tiles to win. The interface prompts users to enter the # of tiles necessary to be consecutive to win the game. The user can play against another player or versus the computer. If they play against the computer, there is an option for an AI SmartPlayer function that utilizes complex algorithms to calculate the perfect move in that situation. 

How to Play:
The interface will direct you through the directions of how to play the game and will prompt the user for how many columns they wish their scaffold to hold. Then it will ask the user what column number they wish to drop their token within, if the column is not a possible value, it will inform the user and prompt them again for a column number. It will then print a visual of the game and which columns have tiles placed in them and the color of those tiles. After someone wins the game, the computer will inform the user and state who has won the game.
